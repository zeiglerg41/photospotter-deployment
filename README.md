## Overview
This repository serves as a centralized location for multi-service orchestration. It can hold combined configuration files (docker-compose, Helm charts) and provide instructions for deploying all Photo Spotter microservices as a cohesive system.

## Integration Setup
- docker-compose for local multi-service testing
- Helm charts or raw Kubernetes manifests for orchestrating all microservices
- Central environment variable or secrets management across services

## Deployment Strategies
- Local development using `docker-compose up` or `kubectl apply -f .`
- Production deployment with Helm or cloud-specific templates (EKS, GKE, AKS)
- Optional CI-based integration tests that spin up all services and run end-to-end checks

## Testing and End-to-End Checks
- Automated scripts to verify cross-service workflows (user sign-up, photo upload, etc.)
- Logging or monitoring setup for system-wide visibility
- Load or stress tests to validate scaling

## Tasks
- Set up docker-compose referencing each service image
- Provide Kubernetes Helm charts or manifests for the entire stack
- Document how to run or test everything together
- Explore end-to-end integration tests in a CI pipeline
